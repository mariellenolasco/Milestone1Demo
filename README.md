# Milestone 1  
Milestone 1 base code for the corporate batch. 

## Overview
The Lodging API is a rest service intended to cater to camping enthusiasts to find the perfect accommodations for their next adventure! It is currently under development. Preliminary models have been made but validation is still missing. Some class properties may need to be implemented as well.

### Goal
Your goal as a developer is to provide the missing implementations such that they:
<ol>
<li> Comply with the behavior and design described in the solution design document </li>
<li> Pass all the unit tests </li>
</ol>

### Hint
The AddressModel has a half implemented validate method that shows you how to proceed

## Testing 
To test your work, go into the folder containing the solution file. 
<br>
Run command ```dotnet test```. 
<br>
This shows you how many tests you've passed.
